        Welcome to my Node.js project! In this module, I've delved into the intricacies of handling server requests and
        orchestrating their transmission in alignment with the MongoDB Atlas database.
        The project zeroes in on managing requests for users and cards. Users have the flexibility to register as either
        business customers or regular customers, dispatch requests based on their permissions, and peruse pertinent
        information.
        Business users can have cards created, and the entire array of cards in the database is accessible, complete
        with
        additional features like liking.
        Administrative users possess the authority to view and manipulate user details, obliterate cards, and oversee
        the
        database's information related to both users and cards.
        For enhanced comprehension and seamless access to request types, I've curated dedicated Postman links. Here, you
        can
        peruse all request varieties, delve into comprehensive documentation, procure details of an admin user for
        managerial
        operations, and more. I extend an invitation to explore and glean insights into the diverse request types
        available.

        ***Prior to usage, I recommend acquainting yourself with the documentation. Detailed explanations are provided
        for both
        user and card requests, a prerequisite before delving into utilization.
        To commence, download the complete folder and execute npm install or yarn in your terminal. Following the
        download, you
        have two operational environments: npm start for the standard environment and npm watch for the developmental
        environment.
        Upon receiving a comprehensive affirmation from the terminal confirming your successful connection to the system
        and the
        database, navigate to the http folder to dispatch requests.
        ***It is imperative to modify the ID and TOKEN values as per each request.
        ***For the seamless transmission of valid and executable requests, I advocate working in tandem with the Postman
        link.
        Feel free to embark on an explorative journey, and if queries arise, please don't hesitate to reach out!
        Enjoy!
