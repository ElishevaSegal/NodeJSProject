Welcome to my Node.js project! In this module, I've explored handling server requests and sending them according to the requirements of the MongoDB Atlas database.

The project focuses on handling requests for users and cards. Users can register as either business customers or regular customers, send requests based on their permissions, and view relevant information. Cards can be created for business users, and all cards in the database can be displayed with additional features like liking.

An admin user can view and edit user details, delete cards, and manage the information in the database for both users and cards.

For the convenience of understanding and easy accessibility of request types, I've prepared a dedicated Postman link where you can see all types of requests, read documentation, receive details of an admin user to perform management operations, and more. You're invited to explore and get comprehensive information about the types of requests available.

***Please refer to the documentation before using the requests. Detailed explanations are available for both user and card requests. This information is required before usage.

To get started, download the entire folder and run npm install or yarn in your terminal. Once the project is downloaded, you have two working environments: npm start for the regular environment and npm watch for the development environment.

After receiving a full confirmation from the terminal that you've connected to the system and the database, navigate to the http folder to send requests.

***Remember to change the ID and TOKEN values according to each request. ***It is recommended to work closely with the Postman link to send valid and ready requests.

Feel free to explore, and if you have any questions, please let me know!
